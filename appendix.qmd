# Commentary on Personalization

[cite_start]The LLM draft provided a useful **structural framework** (Header, Summary, Experience, Projects, Skills)[cite: 10, 13]. [cite_start]The key revisions were focused on authenticity, accuracy, and factual specificity[cite: 13, 14]:

1.  [cite_start]**Authenticity:** The **About Me** section was heavily re-written to capture the "practical, process-driven, and people-first" philosophy and the personal "calm under pressure" strength, rather than using generic MBA mission statements[cite: 40, 44].
2.  [cite_start]**Accuracy (Experience):** Generic ERP names (e.g., SAP/Oracle) were replaced or augmented with the correct tools (**QuickBooks/Sage/Dynamics 365**) and the specific functional knowledge (**3-way match, bank recs**) relevant to Jean's background[cite: 48, 54].
3.  [cite_start]**Factual Detail (Projects):** Placeholder projects were replaced entirely with **four specific academic projects** (Canada Post, Netflix, Urban Leather, IKEA LLM Evaluation) to demonstrate analytical, strategic, and technical application[cite: 51].
4.  [cite_start]**Tone and Style:** The language was refined to be direct and clear, aligning with a disciplined **Accounting/Finance Analyst** target role[cite: 41].
