## 🤖 LLM Output: Site Map and Section Drafts (Raw)

**Prompt used in the LLM (e.g., ChatGPT):** “Create a site map and detailed section outlines for a multi-page MBA portfolio website with pages for Home/About, Resume, Projects/Case Studies, Skills & Certifications, and Contact. Provide sample content and structure for each page.”

### Draft Site Map and Section Outlines

## 📝 Commentary on Personalization and Revision

[cite_start]This section annotates the revisions made to the LLM's raw output to ensure the content is authentic, accurate, and reflects Jean's specific professional narrative.

1.  **Factual Correction (Systems):** The LLM suggested generic ERP systems. These were replaced or augmented with the correct, verified tools from Jean's experience: **Microsoft Dynamics 365, QuickBooks, and Sage**.
2.  **Specificity (Projects):** Generic "data analysis projects" were replaced with the specific, verified academic projects, including the **Canada Post AI/IoT roadmap** and the **Netflix Ad-Supported Tier Marketing Plan**. This showcases applied strategic thinking.
3.  **Quantification:** All quantifiable metrics from the resume (e.g., **98% accuracy**, **20% cost reduction**, **15% AR reduction**) were pulled out and framed as "Case Studies" to maximize impact on the `projects.qmd` page.
4.  **Voice and Philosophy:** Generic MBA phrasing was replaced with Jean's personal philosophy: **"practical, process-driven, and people-first,"** ensuring the site's voice is authentic.
